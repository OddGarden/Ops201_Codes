# What is Ops 201 Code Challenges repo all about? 
> This repository serves as a collection of various challenges undertaken over a rigorous two-month period. The primary objective of these challenges was to augment scripting and automation skills by employing industry-relevant programming languages. These challenges focus on enhancing my ability to automate tedious and repetitive tasks, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency. By exploring diverse challenges ranging from basic to intermidiate levels I was able to gain hands-on experience in coding, debugging, and problem-solving, thereby honing skills in a practical and engaging manner.
# Why are you learning these skills?

# What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201? 
>  Ops 201 Code Challenges have been incredibly helpful to myself as a beginner in several ways:
> * Hands-on Learning: These challenges have helped me gain valuable experience and build confidence in my abilities.
> * Problem-Solving Skills: These challenges have helped me learn to identify and break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components, which I could then solve using scripting.
> * Exposure to Best Practices: These challenges have helped me learn how to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code that is easy to understand and collaborate on.

# What was your favorite Ops 201 Code Challenge assignment and why? 
> One of my favorite scripts is the [Loop Challenge](https://github.com/OddGarden/Ops201_Codes/blob/main/loop_challenge.sh). It is one of my earlier scripts that is a personal milestone. This challenge not only built on my basics, but it pushed me to think logically and as a result I had several iterations all in an attempt to make the script efficient and precise. 

# How can Ops 201 Code Challenges examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace? 
> Learning Bash and PowerShell can be extremely beneficial in the workspace as both are powerful scripting languages that are commonly used in various industries and domains.
> 
> Bash is the default shell in most Unix-based operating systems. It is a versatile and powerful language used for automating repetitive tasks, managing files, and configuring systems. Learning Bash can help streamline common tasks, automate workflows, and improve productivity in the workplace.
> 
> PowerShell is a cross-platform shell and scripting language used for managing Windows operating systems and can be used for system administration, automation, and data analysis. Learning PowerShell can help automate various tasks such as user management, system configurations, and application deployment, among others, thereby improving efficiency and reducing errors.

# What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
> One of the more complex scripts I attempted to write is the [Domain Analyzer](https://github.com/OddGarden/Ops201_Codes/blob/main/domain_analyzer_challenge.sh). I would like to improve this script to include the following stretch objectives:
> * Check that the input is a valid domain name.
> * Research and add additional tools that fetch domain information to your shell script.
> * Sanitize the output to only display useful information.

# What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
> * Get more familiar and comfortable with scripting basic system adminstration tasks such as file handling, directory navigations etc
> * Continue to learn Powershell
> * Improve on best practices (code modularity, testing, debugging and documentation)
