# What is Ops 201 Code Challenges repo all about? 
> This repository is a comprehensive collection of scripting challenges that I completed over a two-month period. These challenges focused on enhancing my automation and scripting skills using industry-relevant programming languages. The challenges were designed to increase my efficiency and productivity by automating tedious and repetitive tasks. Through a range of challenges at different skill levels, I gained valuable experience in coding, debugging, and problem-solving, which helped me hone my skills in a practical and engaging manner.

# Why are you learning these skills?
> As a developer transitioning into the cybersecurity sector, I recognized the importance of improving my scripting and automation skills. While my previous experience in software development is valuable, I needed to learn new skills and apply them in a different context. Taking on the Ops 201 Code Challenges helped me to shape my existing knowledge and apply it to a new and exciting field.

# What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201? 
> The Ops 201 Code Challenges provided me with numerous opportunities to improve my skills as a beginner. Through hands-on learning, I gained valuable experience and built confidence in my abilities. The challenges helped me develop problem-solving skills, which involved breaking down complex problems into manageable components and solving them using scripting. I also gained exposure to best practices, learning how to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code that is easy to understand and collaborate on.

# What was your favorite Ops 201 Code Challenge assignment and why? 
> One of my favorite assignments was the Loop Challenge, which you can find in this [repository](https://github.com/OddGarden/Ops201_Codes/blob/main/loop_challenge.sh). This script was a personal milestone for me, as it not only built on my basic skills but also challenged me to think logically. I iterated several times to make the script efficient and precise, which was a rewarding experience.

# How can Ops 201 Code Challenges examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace? 
>  Learning Bash and PowerShell can be extremely beneficial in the workspace as both are powerful scripting languages that are commonly used in various industries and domains.

> Bash is the default shell in most Unix-based operating systems. It is a versatile and powerful language used for automating repetitive tasks, managing files, and configuring systems. Learning Bash can help streamline common tasks, automate workflows, and improve productivity in the workplace.

> PowerShell is a cross-platform shell and scripting language used for managing Windows operating systems and can be used for system administration, automation, and data analysis. Learning PowerShell can help automate various tasks such as user management, system configurations, and application deployment, among others, thereby improving efficiency and reducing errors.

# What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
> One of the more complex scripts I attempted to write is the Domain Analyzer, which you can find in this [repository](https://github.com/OddGarden/Ops201_Codes/blob/main/domain_analyzer_challenge.sh). If I had more time, I would like to improve this script to include additional stretch objectives, such as checking that the input is a valid domain name, researching and adding additional tools that fetch domain information to the shell script, and sanitizing the output to display only useful information.

# What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
> Moving forward, I hope to improve my skills in basic system administration tasks, such as file handling and directory navigation. Additionally, I plan to continue learning PowerShell to become more proficient in system administration, automation, and data analysis. Finally, I want to improve my skills in best practices, such as code modularity, testing, debugging, and documentation, to ensure that my code is maintainable and easy to follow.
